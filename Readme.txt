Setup:
1) Extract the zip to where you like.
2) Open project with your favourite Java IDE.
3) Rename the packages from "me.tagette.template" to "me.<Your Name>.<Your Plugin>".
4) Replace any instances of Tagette in any if the classes under "src/me".
5) Rename your classes to whatever you like. (Try to keep it standard! For example if your plugin's name was "Basic" then you would rename "TSettings.java" to "BSettings.java".)
6) Add all the .jar files from the lib folder into the libraries of the project.
7) Build and test? YAY!
